/*A linked list is a data structure that stores values in a 
linear fashion. Each value is contained in its own node,
 represented by a head (that is the first node in the list)
  and a tail (that is the last). The link is a pointer/reference 
  to another node object. Singular linked are the cases where each node has just one pointer to another node. 
  Doubly linked lists are where each node has two links. Linked list have one way defined relationships

Doubly/circular linked list- goes back and forth good for 
multiple types of inventory FIFO (first in first out)*/
