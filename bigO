/*The Big O is a mathematical tool we can use 
to evaluate and measure the efficiency of an Algorithm. 
Generally computer programmers use this for worst-case 
scenario but we could calculate the average and 
even best case problem solving operation. 
Big O can be used to describe the time required 
or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
In simple terms how we measure how long it will take for a program to run.
